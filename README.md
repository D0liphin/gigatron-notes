# Gigatron Emulator Notes

This is a file that is to be shared by anyone trying to interpret the gigatron emulator...  
I'm not sure if this is a good way of going about writing notes and I've never seen it done 
before, but it might be helpful?  

Anyway, there is a `.md` file corresponding to every file in the original source code. So you can
fill in any notes you have about each file in the corresponding `.md` file. Please try to keep 
notes to 100 characters wide.

This README.md can contain generic notes on the structure of the emulator. Put these notes under 
and appropriate header.
